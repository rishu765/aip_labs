"""A reference RAG pipeline, written as seven named stages.

Lab 4 asks you to build your own from a skeleton. This file exists so that
Labs 5-7 have a working baseline to improve on, and so you have something to
compare your implementation against.

The reason it is structured as seven explicit stages is the reason for the
whole of Lab 5: when a RAG system gives a wrong answer, "RAG is bad" is not a
diagnosis. Exactly one of these stages usually failed, and each has a
different fix:

    1. ingest    the document was never in the corpus            -> data
    2. chunk     the answer was split across two chunks          -> chunking
    3. embed     the query and passage words do not overlap      -> hybrid/HyDE
    4. retrieve  the right chunk existed but ranked 14th         -> k, rerank
    5. rerank    the right chunk was in the pool but discarded   -> reranker
    6. generate  the right chunk was in context and was ignored  -> prompt
    7. present   correct answer, wrong or missing citation       -> output contract

Trace every stage (this file does) and the diagnosis takes a minute instead
of an afternoon.

You answer questions using ONLY the numbered sources provided.

Rules, in priority order:
1. If the sources do not contain the answer, reply exactly:
   "I don't have enough information in the provided sources to answer that."
   Do not guess, and do not fall back on general knowledge.
2. Every factual sentence must end with a citation of the source(s) that
   support it, in the form [1] or [2][5].
3. Never cite a number that was not given to you.
4. If sources disagree, say so and cite both.
5. Be concise. Two or three sentences unless the question needs more.
