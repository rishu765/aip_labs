"""Content-addressed disk cache for model calls.

Why this exists
---------------
An LLM call is an expensive, slow, non-deterministic function. Almost every
painful thing about developing against one goes away if you make repeated
identical calls free and instant:

* You can re-run a 200-item extraction loop while debugging your parser
  without paying 200 times.
* Your eval harness becomes reproducible: same inputs, same outputs, so a
  diff in your score is a diff in *your code*, not model sampling noise.
* Grading and demos work offline (AIP_OFFLINE=1).

The cache key is a hash of everything that could change the output: model,
messages, temperature, tools, response format, seed. Change any of them and
you get a miss, as you should.
