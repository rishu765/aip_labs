"""The evaluation harness.

This is the most important file in the package.

A GenAI system is a stochastic function. You cannot reason about whether a
change helped by looking at three examples, and you certainly cannot reason
about it by reading the diff. The only way to make progress is to build a
harness first and let it arbitrate.

The shape of every evaluation in this module is the same:

    cases  : a golden set — inputs with known-good outputs
    system : a callable, input -> output           (the thing under test)
    metric : (output, expected) -> dict[str, float]
    report : per-case rows + aggregate + cost + latency, saved to disk

Three families of metric live here:

    1. Deterministic  — exact match, field accuracy, JSON validity.
                        Free, fast, and unarguable. Use these wherever you can.
    2. Retrieval      — recall@k, MRR, nDCG@k, hit rate.
                        Also free. This is why we label retrieval separately
                        from generation: it lets you localise the failure.
    3. LLM-as-judge   — for open-ended text where 1 and 2 cannot reach.
                        Expensive, biased, and must be calibrated against
                        human labels before you are allowed to trust it.
